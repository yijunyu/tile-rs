//! Kernels in the exact shape `mlir_to_tile_rs` emits them, so that rustc
//! checks what review had been checking by eye.
//!
//! That backend's whole purpose is Rust a person can read, and the playground
//! reports a green cell as soon as text comes out — it never compiles it. Every
//! claim that a generated kernel "type-checks" was therefore an inspection of
//! the call shapes, and inspection missed a whole class of defect: the emitter
//! targets the `safe` module, and several wrappers existed only at the top level
//! of `tile::`, so the generated code named functions `safe` did not have. The
//! shapes were right and the code still would not have compiled.
//!
//! These functions are compiled by `cargo check -p tile_std` (the crate is
//! `#![no_core]`, so it cannot host a normal `#[test]`; `#![allow(dead_code)]`
//! is already set crate-wide, which is what lets them sit here unused). If a
//! wrapper is removed, renamed, or has its const generics changed so a real
//! kernel no longer type-checks, this stops building.
//!
//! What this does NOT catch, checked rather than assumed: widening one operand
//! of `rms_norm` from 1536 to 1024 fails to compile, as it should, but changing
//! `attn_gqa`'s destination from 16 to 17 rows compiles fine. `SEQ` there is a
//! free parameter inferred from the destination, and the relation that would
//! pin it — `QROWS == nh * SEQ` — cannot be written, because `nh` is a runtime
//! argument. So this checks that shapes are *consistent*, not that they are the
//! intended ones; an attention kernel with a wrong sequence length still type-
//! checks. That is a limit of the API's typing, not of this module.
//!
//! Bodies are copied from emitter output verbatim apart from the `use` path.
//! Where the playground's bundled shapes are degenerate — its uniform template
//! gives a matvec weight `(1, dim)`, making N collapse to 1 — the *correct*
//! shapes are used instead, since the point is to check the API contract rather
//! than to enshrine a bundle bug.

// ── The composed form: one kernel per stage, joined through GM buffers ──────
//
// Splitting an operator into atomic kernels is what makes every backend reach
// all five attention operators (Compose.v T6), and the tile-rs column only
// reached Local and Strided once `safe` gained the mask wrappers. These are the
// four stages the composer emits for Local at its default shapes, verbatim.
//
// What compiling them does NOT check is the chaining, and the first draft of
// this comment claimed the opposite. Measured: widening stage 1's destination
// from (96, 96) to (96, 97) is 2 errors, because the matmul's result type and
// the store must agree WITHIN a function. But narrowing stage 2 consistently to
// (96, 95) while stage 1 still writes (96, 96) compiles clean — the stages are
// separate functions joined through GM buffers at runtime, and no type links
// one's destination to the next one's source.
//
// So this pins each stage's internal consistency and the wrappers it names, and
// the composer remains the only thing that knows the stages fit together. Worth
// stating plainly, because "the composed chain compiles" would otherwise be
// read as a stronger claim than it is.
