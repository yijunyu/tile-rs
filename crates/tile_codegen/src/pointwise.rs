//! Schema-driven pointwise specialisation — the L2 lift.
//!
//! Two things live here, and they are the two halves of the O6 decision
//! (*monomorphise on the tile, not the tensor*):
//!
//! 1. **Type promotion.** [`elementwise_dtypes`] returns a *pair*: the dtype the
//!    kernel accumulates in, and the dtype it stores. Keeping those separate is
//!    what makes "accumulate f16 in f32" a property of the schema rather than a
//!    thing each operator remembers, and it is where a whole class of accuracy
//!    failures comes from when it is left implicit.
//!
//! 2. **Rank collapse.** [`collapse`] turns any N-D operation over an axis into
//!    `(OUTER, R, INNER)` plus an [`AxisClass`]. Rank then leaves the instance
//!    space entirely, and adversarial extents — `[1009, 1021]`,
//!    `[363, 367, 373]`, `[11, 13, 17, 67, 67]` — are handled by construction
//!    instead of by enumeration.
//!
//! Together they give [`PointwiseSchema::instances`]: the *bounded* set of
//! kernels a schema must emit, keyed by `(dtype, axis-class, TILE)` and never by
//! extent.
//!
//! Std-only and hardware-free, like the rest of this crate — every test here
//! runs on any box.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! The promotion lattice and the computation/result split follow PyTorch's
//! `torch._prims_common::elementwise_dtypes`, which is also what FlagGems'
//! `utils/type_utils.py` calls through to. This is a reimplementation from the
//! specified semantics, not a transcription of a table — see the note on
//! [`elementwise_dtypes`] about what is and is not covered.
