//! The `CodegenTarget` trait — the single seam every backend implements.
//!
//! This is the open tile-rs contract. A target turns a merged MLIR module into
//! target **source** (`emit`). Driving the vendor **toolchain** (source ->
//! object/binary: nvcc / xcrun / bisheng / ptoas) stays host-side in the build
//! crate, because it needs `rustc_session::Session` + the per-vendor settings —
//! deliberately NOT in this trait, so the skeleton is pure, std-only, and
//! testable with no LLVM/CANN/toolchain present (the property that already lets
//! the emitters run 262 tests off-NPU). `emit` is the IP-bearing, unit-testable
//! core; `compile` is mechanical glue layered on top by name.

/// Hardware / codegen knobs a target may read. Host-toolchain targets (CUDA,
/// Metal, …) ignore this; Ascend reads `ub_size`. Std-only so the skeleton stays
/// LLVM-free. This absorbs the one asymmetry in today's backends — `mlir_to_cpp`
/// is the only emitter that takes an extra hardware arg.
