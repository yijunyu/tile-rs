//! Data hazards between vector ops sharing Unified Buffer.
//!
//! This is the check that was missing when the AIV-only build turned five
//! CANNBench operators to garbage. Every constraint in `target.rs` is a
//! RESOURCE constraint -- does the tile fit UB, does the repeat count fit an
//! 8-bit field, does the stride fit 16 bits. All of them ask "is this op
//! legal in isolation". None of them asks whether two ops may run at once,
//! so a kernel could be emitted whose second op read a buffer the first had
//! not finished writing, and nothing in the compiler objected.
//!
//! The hardware did not object either, most of the time. On a MIX-scheduled
//! 910B the races happened to resolve; compiled AIV-only they did not, and
//! `exp` returned inf where it had returned the right answer for months. The
//! bug was always there. Only the schedule changed.
//!
//! ALIASING is the part an adjacency rule cannot see. `ReinterpretCast` gives
//! one piece of storage two names and two element types -- an int32 buffer
//! read as float to reach `Abs` -- so `f0` and `w0` are the same 32 bytes
//! under different spellings. A hazard between them is invisible to anything
//! comparing operand NAMES.
